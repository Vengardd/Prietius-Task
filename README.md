Questions:

If we move directory to HOME, should we move files that are inside of it? If yes, recursively? \
If files that we moved to HOME and we are not moving should we count to count.txt file? \
If we restart program, should we load count.txt file and values from it, or just restart counter? \
What if we change the name of file, should we still move it if it fits our conditions? \
What if there are already existing file in DEV/TEST directory? Should copy it and add to count, or not?
